# GET-HIRED
by Shu Gao


<h2> What and Why? </h2>
  Finding a full-time job or an internship is always a pain for students (or anyone) in the US. The hiring process it convoluted, inefficient, and a lot of times, unnecessarily lengthy. GET-HIRED will be an app that simplifies this process for both students (or any job-seekers) and companies. 
  
<h2> How? </h2>
  The basic features of GET-HIRED will include a standard job post page with all the available job/internship openings including the relevant information. What makes GET-HIRED stand out from other job search engines and recruiting platforms is the feature of directly communicating with the recruiter. In the app, the job-seeker will submit their resume, which are pre-loaded into their profile upon sign up, to the recruiters who posted the job listing. The job-seeker then sends a simple message like "Hi, I am interested in the listing" to the recruiter. If the recruiter thinks that the person who messaged them can be a potential fit for the role, they will send a message back, and a conversation will be initiated. Otherwise, the recruiter can reject the incoming message from the job-seeker if they are not a good fit. From thereon, the recruiter can provide direct information about the specific hiring process for the matched job-seeker and help them move along to hopefully GET-HIRED. This simplifies the hiring process and allows both companies and job-seekers to find the right match more efficaciously.
